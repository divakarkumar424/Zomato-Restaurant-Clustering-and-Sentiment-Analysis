# Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis
Business Problem Analysis
Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. With every state, you can find something different to love. Besides traditional North Indian and South Indian food, the food culture is heavily inspired by and evolved around various civilizations. To say that Indians are food lovers would be an understatement. The restaurant business in India has been booming and people even like to celebrate small occasions of their lives with good food and great ambience. The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However, it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. This Zomato data aims to analysing the demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurants which will help in finding the overall rating for the place.

In this notebook, I will try analyzing the Business Problem of Zomato and create a practical recommendation system for users.

The problem statement here has two datasets for us to work on:
* Zomato Restaurant Names and Metadata
* Zomato Restaurant Reviews

To ensure Zomato's success the company needs to analyze its datasets and make appropriate strategic decisions. The problem statement here asks us to cluster the restaurants to help customers find the best restaurants in their city and according to their taste understand the fields they are lagging in. This will help Zomato in building a good recommendation system for their customers. Do a cost-benefit analysis using the cuisines and costs of the restaurants. To understand fields that need to be worked upon, it is important to do sentiment analysis to get an idea about how people feel about a particular restaurant. To identify the industry critics and especially work on their reviews to build a reputation worth praising.
